# Easy Jira for Unity
*Open source version of the currently deprecated Unity asset: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/easy-jira-111744
The asset was deprecated due to the use of the word “Jira” in the name*

Easy Jira fully integrates Jira with Unity and allows you to easily implement a feedback system for your game in less than 5 minutes. Creates Jira Issues from an in-game feedback form. The asset uses basic authentication, so you can setup your user roles and allow to create issues using only the desired issue types.

### Main features

- Administration of issues from the Unity editor. (create, assign, add comments, etc)

- Attach a customizable log file to the issue. You can select to include the default Debug.Log() entries to get errors or warnings. Also, you can use a custom log object to separate and attach only your custom log.

- Capture and attach a screenshot when the player send the feedback form.
